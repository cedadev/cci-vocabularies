proc_level0`Level 0`L0`Unprocessed instrument and payload data at full resolution. CCI does not make recommendations regarding formats or content for data at this processing level.`https://www.ghrsst.org/
proc_level1`Level 1`L1``
proc_level1A`Level 1A`L1A`Reconstructed unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters, computed and appended, but not applied, to L0 data.`https://www.ghrsst.org/
proc_level1B`Level 1B`L1B`Level 1A data that have been processed to sensor units.`https://www.ghrsst.org/
proc_level1C`Level 1C`L1C`Level 1b data that have been further processed, e.g. by correcting radiances or by mapping onto a spatial grid, prior to deriving geophysical variables from the data.`
proc_level2`Level 2`L2`Retrieved environmental variables at the same resolution and location as the level 1 source`http://wiki.ieee-earth.org/@api/deki/files/7/=Handbook_0802.pdf
proc_level2P`Level 2 Pre-processing`L2P`Geophysical variables derived from Level 1 source data at the same resolution and location as the level 1 data, typically in a satellite projection with geographic information.
