These are required to support the work of the UNFCCC and the IPCC. All ECVs are technically and economically feasible for systematic observation. It is these variables for which international exchange is required for both current and historical observations. Additional variables required for research purposes are not included.`0.0.1`http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/`
