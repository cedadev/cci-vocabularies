The use of a concept scheme allows easy navigation up and down the tree as well as providing relationships to concepts from other DRS. As well as relationships between sensors and platforms, each ECV concept is related to one or more data type concepts.</p><h5>SKOS Navigation Down the Concept Scheme</h5><img src=../../../scheme/cci/conceptSchemeDown.svg /><h5>SKOS Navigation Up the Concept Scheme</h5><img src=../../../scheme/cci/conceptSchemeUp.svg /><h4>Collections</h4><p>The named individuals of each class are also represented as members in SKOS collections: <a href=../../../collection/cci/dataType>data type</a>, <a href=../../../collection/cci/ecv>ecv</a>, <a href=../../../collection/cci/freq>frequency</a>, <a href=../../../collection/cci/org>institutes</a>, <a href=../../../collection/cci/platform>platforms</a>, <a href=../../../scheme/cci/platformGrp>platform groups</a>, <a href=../../../scheme/cci/platformProg>platform programs</a>, <a href=../../../collection/cci/procLev>processing levels</a>, <a href=../../../collection/cci/product>products</a>, <a href=../../../collection/cci/project>projects</a>,  and <a href=../../../collection/cci/sensor>sensors</a>.
